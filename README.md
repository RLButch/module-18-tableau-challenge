Aim: to identify two unexpected phenomena through the aggregation of the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and tableau visualisations.

Resources:  
Python, juypter notebook, tableau,     
Data Source: Citi Bike System Data page  
Assistance: tableau class exercises, tableau online manual, tutorial sessions    

Methodology:     
1). Download 3 CSV files from the citibike website, I chose Dec 2019, Jan 2020 and Feb 2020    
2). I used Pandas in vsc to merge the files and change the time to datetime, then resave the file as one csv    
3). Upload into Tableau public to create visualisations    
4). Created 2 dashboards, one looking at the citibike start station and another looking at use by gender.    

Tableau public dashboards and visualations can be viewed at this url:
